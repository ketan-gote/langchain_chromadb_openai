# Langchain Chromadb OpenAI
Generative AI with custom Knowledge base using OpenAI, ChatGPT3.5 Model, Langchain, ChromaDB

This example focus on how to feed Custom Data as Knowledge base to OpenAI and then do Question and Answere on it. Here, we explore the capabilities of ChromaDB, an open-source vector embedding database that allows users to perform semantic search. ChromaDB stores documents as dense vector embeddings, which are typically generated by transformer-based language models, allowing for nuanced semantic retrieval of documents.

## Run use_case1.py file. 
- This will Scan the text files which are present in './documents' folder
- It will create chunks of text files and store in chroma db
- After that you can send query which will be answere based on local knowledge base
